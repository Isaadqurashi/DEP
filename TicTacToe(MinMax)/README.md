# TicTacToe Game with Minimax AI

## Author: Saad Khurshid

### Overview

This project is a simple implementation of a TicTacToe game with a graphical user interface (GUI) built using Tkinter. The game features an AI opponent that uses the Minimax algorithm to determine its moves, ensuring a challenging experience for the player.

### Features

- **Single Player Mode**: Play against the computer.
- **Minimax Algorithm**: The AI uses the Minimax algorithm to play optimally.
- **Graphical User Interface**: Easy-to-use interface created with Tkinter.
- **Reset Option**: Restart the game at any time.

### Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Tkinter library (usually included with Python installations)

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/Isaadqurashi/DEP/tree/main/TicTacToe(MinMax)
    cd tictactoe-minimax
    ```

2. **Run the Game**:
    ```sh
    python tictactoe.py
    ```

### How to Play

1. **Start the Game**: Run the Python script to open the game window.
2. **Make Your Move**: Click on an empty cell to place your 'X'.
3. **AI Move**: The AI will automatically make its move using the Minimax algorithm.
4. **Reset the Game**: Click the 'reset' button to start a new game.

### Code Structure

- **tictactoe.py**: Main script containing the game logic and GUI implementation.
- **Board Class**: Manages the game state, including player moves, checking for wins, and the Minimax algorithm.
- **GUI Class**: Handles the graphical interface, user interactions, and updating the display.

### Future Improvements

- Add multiplayer support.
- Implement different difficulty levels for the AI.
- Enhance the GUI with more features and better design.
