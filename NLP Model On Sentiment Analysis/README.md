# TASK 4
# Project Title: Sentiment Analysis in Python

## Description
This project analyzes sentiment in Amazon food reviews using VADER and RoBERTa models. The primary goal is to evaluate customer sentiments based on their reviews, providing insights into product reception.

## Motivation
The motivation behind this project is to leverage natural language processing techniques to understand consumer sentiments from vast amounts of text data. This analysis can help businesses improve their products and services by addressing customer feedback effectively.

## Features
- Sentiment analysis using VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner)
- Sentiment analysis using the RoBERTa pretrained model from Hugging Face
- Visualization of sentiment scores against review ratings
- Easy-to-follow instructions for data loading and analysis

## Installation
To set up the project, ensure you have Python installed, then install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install nltk transformers pandas seaborn matplotlib
```

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Isaadqurashi/DEP/tree/main/NLP%20Model%20On%20Sentiment%20Analysis.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd NLP-AmazonReviews
   ```
3. Run the Jupyter notebook or Python script to perform sentiment analysis on the dataset:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
   or
   ```bash
   python sentiment_analysis.py
   ```

## Data
The dataset used in this project is the Amazon Fine Food Reviews dataset, which can be downloaded from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/snap/amazon-fine-food-reviews).

## Results
The analysis provides both VADER and RoBERTa sentiment scores for each review, allowing for a comparative understanding of sentiment analysis techniques.

## Challenges
During the development of this project, challenges included handling large datasets, ensuring accurate sentiment scoring, and visualizing the results effectively.

## Future Work
- Implement additional sentiment analysis models for comparison.
- Enhance visualization techniques for better insights.
- Explore multilingual sentiment analysis capabilities.

## Credits
